# Spring Damper
The animation belows show the numerical simulation of a mass
connected to a spring and damper. The following equation of motion
has been applied, where m is the weight of the mass, b is the damping
factor and k is the spring constant.

$$
    m\ddot x + b\dot x + k x = F(t)
$$
Where F(t) = 0

After creating the spring visualization, it was discovered that the
function made it simple to make quite the mesmerizing animations, such as
the animations shown below.
